## Objective:

mSafe is a company which provides a service for safe document sharing among users (companies/banks). In order to do
this, they implement multi-factor authentication to ensure that the user can access the service with the utmost safety.
This requires an additional step to authenticate the user. Currently, this is done through a one-time password which is
sent via SMS. However, this is causing a burden on the company's servers, costing around 18,000 SMS per day. The main
idea of the project is to develop a mobile application that can help the user authenticate themselves in an easier way,
so the user does not need to copy the password sent by SMS and mSafe does not need to generate and send a password to
the user.<br/>

## Organization<br/>

* **The development team**:<br/>
  Mo kadib alban, Alex Diependaal, Jill Jessurun, Junghee Kim and Joey de Jong<br/>
  the team is responsible for developing the mobile application, and deliver at lease a prototype which can be used/
  profited by mSafe, in addition to the needed documentations<br/>
* **The company (mSafe)**<br/>
  mSafe represented by the CEO Atze Zwirs who is responsible for the needed information ,logistics needed during the
  project and feedback in every sprint review<br/>
* **the developerâ€™s HvA consultant**<br/>
  Robert Fransdonk, who is responsible for the consultancy of the team and maintain the process

## Approach:

The project will be done according to scrum methode, the project will be finished in 4 sprints, a sprint is three weeks
during this sprint daily stand-ups will be held within the team to discuss the progress of developing the app.
A project backlog will be made which contains the user stories related to the features of the application.
At the end of every sprint, a sprint review will be held with the consultant and mSafe represented by Atze Zwirs. It is
expected to deliver and present a minimum viable product that can be improved in the following sprint.
At the end of every sprint, a sprint retrospective will be held within the development team to discuss the things to be
improved and the actions that need to be taken.
The Scrum roles will be rotated within the team so every team member will have the experience of all roles.
